This plugin is still under development...

## Plugin's Objective ##

This plugin adds functionalities to use the new Google reCAPTCHA in CakePHP
projects.
For now multiple widgets on a single page is not available.

## Requirements ##

- PHP >= 5.4.16
- [CakePHP 3.x](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/index.html)
- Server under `localhost` name. Be aware that the widgets will not be displayed
  if you have a vhost named local.dev/dev/ for instance.

## Installation ##

_[Using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)]_

Add the plugin to your project's `composer.json` - something like this:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "cake17/cakephp-recaptcha": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

And run `composer update`.

Because this plugin has the type `cakephp-plugin` set in it's own
`composer.json`, composer knows to install it inside your `/vendor` directory.
It is recommended that you add `/vendor` to your .gitignore file.
(Why? [read this](http://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).)

## Usage of plugin ##

### 1. Enable the plugin

In your `config/bootstrap.php` file:

    Plugin::load('Recaptcha', ['routes' => true, 'bootstrap' => true]);

### 2. Go to Google reCAPTCHA site

Go [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html) to create a pair
of keys for your website.

### 3. Create or copy the reCAPTCHA config file

- Either copy the default file in `/config/recaptcha.php` from
  `/vendor/cake17/cakephp-recaptcha/config/recaptcha.default.php`.

- Either use the composer install command to add in composer.json that will
  make the copy for you
  To use it, add the following snippet in your project composer.json and run
  `composer run-script post-install-cmd` after::

      ...
      "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
          "Recaptcha\\Console\\Installer::postInstall"
        ]
      }
      ...

Whatever the method you used to copy the recaptcha config file, don't forget to
put `/config/recaptcha.php` file in .gitignore.

### 4. Fullfill the information in `/config/recaptcha.php`

- sitekey: get it on google website
- secret: get it on google website
- lang: see the list on google website
- theme: dark or light
- type: image or audio

If you don't have a key and a secret, an exception will be raised.

### 5. Then add the component in your controller where you need the reCAPTCHA.

For example:

    public function initialize() {
        parent::initialize();
        if ($this->request->action === 'contact') {
            $this->loadComponent('Recaptcha.Recaptcha');
        }
    }

### 6. Add the following in your controller.

    public function contact() {
        if ($this->request->is('post')) {
            if ($this->Recaptcha->verify()) {
                if ($contact->execute($this->request->data)) {
                    $this->Flash->success(__('We will get back to you soon.'));
                    return $this->redirect($this->referer());
                } else {
                    $this->Flash->error(__('There was a problem submitting your form.'));
                }
            } else {
                $this->Flash->error(__('Please check your Recaptcha Box.'));
            }
        }
    }

### 7. No need to add the helper.

It will be added with the component.

### 8. Finally add `<?= $this->Recaptcha->display() ?>` in your view template inside the form.

For example:

    <?= $this->Form->create() ?>
    <?= $this->Recaptcha->display() ?>

    <?= $this->Form->input('name', [
      'label' => __('Your Name'),
      // 'default' => $this->request->query('name'); // in case you add the Prg Component
    ]) ?>
    <?= $this->Form->input('message', [
      'type' => 'textarea',
      // 'default' => $this->request->query('message'); // in case you add the Prg Component
      'label' => __('Your Message')
    ]) ?>

    <?= $this->Form->button(__('OK')) ?>
    <?= $this->Form->end() ?>

See another example of contact with no form in
`src/Controller/ContactController.php`, `src/Template/Contact/index.ctp` and
`src/Form/ContactForm.php`. You can test it by going to
`http://localhost/recaptcha/contact`.
